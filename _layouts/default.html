      <p>I'm a software engineer from New Zealand, living and working in Amsterdam. I work on backend (mostly) and frontend projects typically using Golang, Ruby, and NodeJS.</p>
      <p>I believe primarily in readable software, intention-revealing interfaces, domain-driven design, and choosing abstractions and tools that suit the problems you have at hand.</p>
      <p>I'm also interested in transportation, livable cities, and the transformative power that cycling has on the quality of life in urban environments.</p>
      <p>I'm currently working with <a class="link dim blue" href="https://www.messagebird.com">MessageBird</a> in Amsterdam. In the past I have worked with <a class="link dim blue" href="https://consumer.org.nz">Consumer New Zealand</a> and <a class="link dim blue" href="https://ikegps.com">ikeGPS</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>I'm currently open for work in Amsterdam (or remote) starting August.</strong></p>
